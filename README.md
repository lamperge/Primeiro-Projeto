# Primeiro-Projeto

## Skills Used

## Project Errors

### 1. Mobile Friendly
At the time I did this first project, I had no idea how to use media queries and not even use the "inspect" of google chrome to see how the result would look on screens of other devices. Today I have a much better idea of this and in the future I intend to adjust this on this site.

### 2. Dirty Code
As it was one of the first projects of my life, I had a little difficulty doing it. That's why the code is very dirty and with some lines probably unnecessary.
